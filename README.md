# Instructions
Both Client and Server are on the same folder so:
For each directory you should: 
    npm install
    npm run dev

Server runs on port 5000.
Client runs on port 5173.

After running both the Server and the client just type https://localhost:5173 on your browser's address bar.

Then just click a phone to see the details from the list.

Notes:
Did not found the need to add a Navbar for such a simple project as there is no navigations.
100% responsive.
Decided to have a little different aproach to what was asked, so the loading screens are simulated via JS.
