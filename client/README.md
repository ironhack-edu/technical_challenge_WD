# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


### What to do first
To use this code is better to first:
npm i or npm install

To get all the dependencies that you will need to run the code.

### How to run it
And to run it write:
npm run dev

### How it works:

The purpose of this code is that on the first page it will display all the
images as links of each phone

Had some error when one should display all info after click in the same page
But tried to do a work around as to go to another link to display all the info there.

On the other page it will get all the info and display all the info that corresponds
to the phone id.
